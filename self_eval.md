# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- It is useful to use a conditional when you are dealing with a boolean true/false scenario with different output options.

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- I would have spent less time fleshing out some of the responses in the original comparison file to be more efficient with my time.

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- I was happy when I finally got the code to work consistently for the mild challenge so I could wrap up this assignment. I actually found that to be more difficult than the mild challenge since I had to look up how to calculate odd/even using code, whereas for the mild challenge I was able to dive in using the info from the turing lesson. I'll try the spicy challenge later on when I have everything else submitted.
